I am advised by [Prof. Jian Huang](https://jianh.web.engr.illinois.edu/) as a member of the [Systems Platform Research Group](https://platformxlab.github.io/). My research interest lies in the fields of operating systems and storage systems. I really enjoy in hacking Linux Kernels.\n\nPrior to my Ph.D. study, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in ECE from UIUC.\n\n\n# Recent Publications\n\n> **The Security War in File Systems: An Empirical Study from A Vulnerability-Centric Perspective** </br>\nJinghan Sun, **Shaobo Li**, Jun Xu, Jian Huang</br>\n*ACM Transactions on Storage (TOS '23)*</br>\n\\[[paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3606020)\\] \n\n> **LeaFTL: A Learning-Based Flash Translation Layer for Solid-State Drives**</br>\nJinghan Sun, **Shaobo Li**, Yunxin Sun, Chao Sun, Dejan Vucinic, Jian Huang</br>\n*International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems (ASPLOS '23)*</br>\n\\[[paper](https://my-henrys.github.io/papers/leaftl-asplos2023.pdf)\\] \\[[code](https://github.com/platformxlab/leaftl)\\] \\[[slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aHXXGhyXspsykCvXyuic7pvEgydL6hwF/view)\\] \n\n\n# Experience\n<!-- ## Intership -->\n<!-- > <div style=\"text-align:left;\">\n    <span class=\"\"emphasized;\">\n    Research Intern\n    </span>\n    <span style=\"float:right;\">\n        May 2023 - Aug 2023\n    </span>\n</div>\nAlibaba Cloud</br> -->\n## Intership\n> **Alibaba Cloud** </br>\n>  Research Intern ( May 2023 - Aug 2023 ) </br>\n> Worked on the log-structured file system for Alibaba's Pangu, leveraging learned indexing to optimize indexing overhead in large scaled file system.\n\n## Teaching\n> **ECE391 Computer Systems Engineering**</br>\n>  Graduate TA, Spring 2023 \n\n> **ECE411 Computer Organization and Design**</br>\n>  Graduate TA, Fall 2023 \n>  Volunteer TA, Spring 2022\n\n## Services\n> **Artifact Evaluation Committee**\n> - EuroSys 2022\n> - ASPLOS 2023\n\n<!-- - [Research](research)\n- [Random](random)\n- [Github](https://link.dendron.so/6b24) -->\n\n\n  ","n":0.066}}}]}
